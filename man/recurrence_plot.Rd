\title{Recurrence plot for a time series}
\usage{
recurrence_plot(x, embed = 2L, delay = 1L, eps = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector representing the time series.}

\item{embed}{Integer embedding dimension. Defaults to 2.}

\item{delay}{Integer delay between coordinates in the embedding. Defaults to 1.}

\item{eps}{Positive radius for defining recurrences. If NULL, uses 10% of the standard deviation of `x`.}
}
\value{
A logical matrix representing the recurrence plot. Points within `eps` distance are marked as TRUE.
}
\description{
Compute a simple recurrence plot using delay embedding.
}
\examples{
rp <- recurrence_plot(rnorm(100))
image(rp)
}
