\title{Threshold selection diagnostics}
\usage{
threshold_diagnostics(x, thresholds, k_values)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector of observations.}

\item{thresholds}{Numeric vector of candidate thresholds for MRL.}

\item{k_values}{Integer vector of order statistics counts for the Hill plot.}
}
\value{
List with components `mrl` and `hill`, containing data frames for
  each diagnostic. If some thresholds or `k_values` are invalid they are
  dropped silently from the output.
}
\description{
Provides tools for assessing appropriate thresholds for POT analysis,
including Mean Residual Life (MRL) and Hill plots.
}
\examples{
set.seed(123)
x <- rpois(1000, lambda = 3)
diag <- threshold_diagnostics(x, seq(0, 6, by = 0.5), 1:50)
mrl_plot(diag$mrl)
hill_plot(diag$hill)
