\title{Logistic Map Time Series}
\format{
A numeric vector with 5000 observations
}
\source{
Generated using \code{simulate_logistic_map(n = 5000, r = 3.8, x0 = 0.2)}
}
\usage{
logistic_ts
}
\description{
A time series generated from the logistic map with parameter r = 3.8,
demonstrating chaotic behavior. This dataset is useful for extreme value
analysis and testing extremal index estimation methods.
}
\details{
Generated using the logistic map equation: x_{n+1} = r * x_n * (1 - x_n)
with r = 3.8 and initial condition x_0 = 0.2. This parameter value
produces chaotic dynamics with interesting extreme value properties.
