\title{Mixing diagnostics utilities}
\usage{
acf_decay(x, lags)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector containing the time series.}

\item{lags}{Integer vector of lags for correlation or mixing calculations.}

\item{threshold}{Numeric threshold for exceedance-based tests.}
}
\value{
Depends on the function. For `acf_decay` this is a numeric vector of
  autocorrelation values. Returns `NA` when `lags` contains values larger than
  the length of the series.
}
\description{
Provides functions to compute auto-correlation decay, estimate simple mixing
coefficients, and check Leadbetter's D(un) condition for extreme value
theory applications.
}
\examples{
# Simulate logistic map
x <- simulate_logistic_map(1000, r = 3.8, x0 = 0.2)

# Compute ACF decay
acf_vals <- acf_decay(x, lags = 1:10)
plot(1:10, acf_vals, type = "b", xlab = "Lag", ylab = "ACF")
}
