\title{Marked Point Processes of Exceedances for Dynamical Systems}
\description{
Implements Rare Events Point Processes (REPP), Excesses Over Threshold (EOT),
Peaks Over Threshold (POT), and Area Over Threshold (AOT) marked point processes
as described in Moreira–Freitas–Magalhães (2018). Provides tools for threshold selection,
cluster identification, MPP construction, and fitting compound Poisson limits.
