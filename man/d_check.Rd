\title{Check D(un) condition}
\usage{
d_check(x, threshold, r)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector containing the time series.}

\item{threshold}{High threshold `u_n` for exceedances.}

\item{r}{Integer lag between exceedances.}
}
\value{
Logical indicating whether the empirical estimate suggests the D(un)
  condition holds at lag `r`. Returns `FALSE` when `r` exceeds the length of
  the series.
}
\description{
Evaluates a heuristic version of Leadbetter's D(un) mixing condition by
comparing joint exceedance probabilities at lag `r` with the product of
marginals for a high threshold `u_n`.
}
\examples{
x <- simulate_logistic_map(1000, r = 3.8, x0 = 0.2)
d_check(x, threshold = 0.9, r = 5)
