\title{Estimate Extremal Index Using Runs Method}
\usage{
extremal_index_runs(x, threshold, run_length)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector. The time series to analyze. Should be stationary
or at least have stationary extremal behavior. Must contain enough data
to get reliable exceedance counts (typically n > 500 for threshold at
90th-95th percentile).}

\item{threshold}{Numeric scalar. Values above this are considered exceedances.
Should be a high quantile of the data (typically 0.90-0.99). The choice
affects both the estimate and its variance:
- Higher threshold: fewer exceedances, higher variance, less bias
- Lower threshold: more exceedances, lower variance, potential bias
Use \code{\link{threshold_diagnostics}} for guidance on selection.}

\item{run_length}{Integer. The maximum gap (in time steps) between
exceedances that are considered part of the same cluster. Typical
values are 1 or 2. Larger values may be appropriate for systems with
long-range dependence. Must be positive.}
}
\value{
Numeric scalar giving the extremal index estimate, a value in (0, 1].
Returns NA if there are no exceedances above the threshold.

**Interpreting the result**:
- Values close to 1: weak clustering, nearly independent extremes
- Values around 0.5-0.7: moderate clustering (common in chaotic systems)
- Values below 0.5: strong clustering, extremes appear in bursts

Use \code{\link{bootstrap_extremal_index}} to obtain confidence intervals
for quantifying uncertainty.

\description{
Estimates the extremal index θ from time series data using the runs
estimator. The extremal index quantifies the degree of clustering in
extreme values, with θ = 1 indicating independence and θ < 1 indicating
clustering.
}
\details{
## Overview
The extremal index θ ∈ (0, 1] is a fundamental parameter in extreme
value theory for dependent sequences. It measures the tendency of extreme
values to appear in clusters rather than individually.

## Interpretation of θ
- **θ = 1**: Extreme values occur independently (like IID data)
- **θ < 1**: Extreme values cluster together
- **θ = 0.5**: On average, extremes appear in pairs
- **θ = 0.33**: On average, extremes appear in triplets

In chaotic dynamical systems, θ is typically less than 1 because the
system's deterministic nature causes extreme events to cluster. The
value of θ depends on the system's mixing properties and the choice
of threshold.

## The Runs Method
The runs estimator defines clusters based on the gaps between exceedances.
Two exceedances belong to the same cluster if they are separated by at
most `run_length` time steps. The estimator is:
\deqn{\hat{\theta} = \frac{N_c}{N}}
where \eqn{N_c} is the number of clusters and N is the total number of
exceedances.

## Choosing run_length
The choice of `run_length` affects the estimate:
- **Too small**: May split natural clusters, overestimating θ
- **Too large**: May merge distinct clusters, underestimating θ

Common choices:
- run_length = 1 or 2 for most applications
- run_length based on ACF structure (first zero crossing)
- run_length based on extremal index diagnostics

## Relationship to Return Times
The extremal index affects return times for extreme events. For a
threshold u with exceedance probability p, the mean cluster size is
1/θ and the mean inter-cluster time is 1/(θp).

\section{Mathematical Background}{

For a stationary sequence {X_n}, the extremal index is defined as:
\deqn{\theta = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{P(M_n \le u_n)^n}{P(X_1 \le u_n)}}
where \eqn{M_n = \max(X_1, \ldots, X_n)} and \eqn{u_n} is a high threshold
satisfying nP(X_1 > u_n) → τ for some τ > 0.

The runs estimator was introduced by Smith & Weissman (1994) and
provides a consistent estimator under appropriate mixing conditions.
